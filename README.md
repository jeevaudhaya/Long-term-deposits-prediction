# Long-term-deposits-prediction
 Different machine learning models are used to predict the customer subscription of the long-term deposit namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. These classification models are compared based on their performance such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
 
 In this experiment, the main aim is to increase the model performance than the previous experiments and compare the machine learning model results and identify the best classification model for classifying the prospective customers who have the potential to be interested in long-term deposit products.
 
### Dataset:
 
 The proposed algorithm evaluated using Bank portugal dataset from UCI machine learning where this dataset belongs from bank retail in portugal by 2008-2010 years.
 The dataset consists of 4119 records, 20 attributes and 2 labels is deposit and non-deposit.
   
 Data is collected from website.
